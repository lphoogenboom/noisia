    "\n",
    "You have recently gotten involved in amateur RF communication, and you have finally managed to trasnmit a signal wirelessly! Your setup constists of one broadcasting antenna and three receiving ones, placed at different distances from the emitter, specifically 5cm, 100cm, and 200cm. The signal you sent was a short recording of a piano note. Upon receiving it however, you realise that it has been corrupted by noise. So now you want to apply what you have learned in the Statistical Signal Analysis course and try to remove the noise. Since the nature of the interference is stochastic, you want to subtract the effects of the distortion by using the theory of Wiener filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the configuration of the figure below, all signals are discrete-time and real.\n",
    "The corrupted signal $x(n) = d(n) + v(n)$ contains both the signal of interest $d(n)$ and a noise $v(n)$ which is _uncorrelated_ to d(n).\n",
    "In this assignment you will design a FIR filter $W(z)$, such that we can estimate the ground truth signal from $x(n)$ and from the statistical properties of the noise.\n",
